    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",

    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",

    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. "
